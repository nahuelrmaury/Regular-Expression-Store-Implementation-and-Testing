# Regular Expression Store Implementation and Testing

In this task, we will implement various functions in the 'RegularExpressionStore' class from the 'RegularExpression.Task' assembly. The 'RegularExpressionStore' class is responsible for handling regular expressions and providing various functionality related to pattern matching and manipulation.

Additionally, we have a set of unit tests in the 'RegularExpression.Test' assembly that will validate the correctness of the implemented functions.

## Introduction

The 'RegularExpressionStore' class contains functions related to regular expressions, including pattern matching, replacement, and more. The goal is to implement these functions correctly to ensure their proper functionality.

## Implementation Steps

1. Open the 'RegularExpressionStore.cs' file from the 'RegularExpression.Task' assembly.
2. Implement all the functions defined in the 'RegularExpressionStore' class. These functions should include regular expression pattern matching, replacement, and any other relevant operations.
3. Ensure that the implemented functions are well-documented with comments explaining their purpose and usage.

## Unit Testing

The 'RegularExpression.Test' assembly contains unit tests that are designed to validate the correctness of the implemented functions. These tests cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure robust functionality.

To run the unit tests:
1. Open the 'RegularExpression.Test' project in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution to ensure that the latest 'RegularExpressionStore' implementation is compiled.
3. Run the unit tests by using your preferred testing framework (e.g., MSTest, NUnit, xUnit).

Check the test results to confirm that all tests pass successfully, indicating that the 'RegularExpressionStore' functions are working as expected.

## Conclusion

This README outlines the task of implementing functions in the 'RegularExpressionStore' class and validating their correctness using unit tests from the 'RegularExpression.Test' assembly. Proper implementation of these functions is crucial for reliable regular expression handling within the application.
